  This application is a portfolio using React and Javascript to showcase my projects. The nav links will take the user between the four pages. On the portfolio page, they can view samples of my projects, and go to the repos, deployed sites, or demo videos for more details. On the contact page, they can send me a message. On the resume page, they can view my profiencies, or click a link to be taken to a downloadable copy of my resume. In the footer, they can click the icons to go to my GitHub, LinkedIn profile, or Indeed resume. 

  Live site deployed to Netlify at:  https://salokinreactportfolio.netlify.app/
